# Hotel Management System

## About
  In this project we are trying to build a health care management system which will help in managing data
Of doctors, their corresponding patients, and as well data of patientâ€™s invoice, diet, insurance and other details. The DBMS can track and update all the information of recorded patients in the healthcare center
During a particular span of time. The major advantages of the DBMS are easy to retrieve and update information, efficient data sharing and communication, and reliable backup and security. This system is to facilitate the center to retrieve, update and report the patient information.
